# Illuminati Joke Program

A joke program that scans the screen for triangles and overlays them with the Illuminati logo while playing the X-Files theme.

It uses OpenCV for recognizing the triangles. The AI is OK, but sometimes generates false-positives or does not recognize a triangle at all.

It currently only works for the active window and only on the main screen.
